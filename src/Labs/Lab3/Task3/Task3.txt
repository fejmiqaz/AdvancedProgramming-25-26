It is necessary to implement a system for enrolling applicants at a university. The system manages:

Faculties
Study Programs
Applicants
The class Applicant:

id: int- unique identifier of the applicant
name: String- name of the applicant
gpa: double- high school average
subjectsWithGrade: List<SubjectWithGrade>- list of objects of the type SubjectWithGradewhere data on passed matriculation exams is stored
studyProgramme: StudyProgramme- the study program in which the applicant is enrolled
Implement the method addSubjectAndGrade(String subject, int grade)that adds a subject and grade to the list.

In this class, it is necessary to implement the method: calculatePointswhich calculates how many total points an applicant has for the specific study program:

average * 12
for each subject in the matriculation examination:
if the subject is on the list of appropriate subjects at the faculty: grade * 2
if the course is NOT on the list of appropriate courses at the faculty: grade * 1.2

The class StudyProgrammecontains data for:

code: String- study program code
name: String- name of the study program
numPublicQuota: int- number of applicants who can enroll in the state quota
numPrivateQuota: int- number of applicants who can enroll in a private quota
enrolledInPublicQuota: int- number of applicants enrolled in the state quota
enrolledInPrivateQuota: int- number of applicants enrolled in a private quota
applicants: List<Applicant>- list of applicants
In this class, it is necessary to implement the method calculateEnrollmentNumbersthat will calculate and set the values ​​of enrolledInPublicQuotaand enrolledInPrivateQuota.

Important: The state quota is filled first, and then the private quota.

To overload it toString()so that it displays:

program name
all applicants admitted to the state quota
all applicants admitted to the private quota
all rejected applicants
The class Facultycontains data for:

shortName: String- abbreviated name of the faculty (FINKI, FEIT, MEDFAK)
appropriateSubjects: List<String>- list of subjects that are appropriate for the faculty
studyProgrammes: List<StudyProgramme>- list of study programs
To also overload toStringthe method that will print all study programs and applicants to the faculty according to the following criteria:

the number of relevant courses at the faculty in ascending order
the percentage of students admitted to a study program in descending order
((number of students enrolled in the state quota + number of students enrolled in the private quota) / (number of places in the state quota + number of places in the private quota)) * 100
student's points in descending order
Implement the two methods in the class EnrollmentsIOthat are used for entering and printing data.

The method readEnrollments:

takes a list of study programs and an InputStream as arguments
searches for the study program in the list of study programs according to the code entered
creates the Applicant object, sets the attributes, and adds it to the list of applicants for the appropriate study program
The input format is as follows:

id;name;gpa;subject1:grade1;subject2:grade2;subject3:grade3;subject4:grade4;studyProgrammeCode

where id is the applicant's identifier, name is the applicant's name, gpa is the applicant's grade point average, subjectN and gradeN are the subjects he/she took on the matriculation exam, and studyProgrammeCode is the study program he/she wants to enroll in.

The method printRanked:

receives a list of faculties as an argument
prints all faculties according to the format available in the test examples and according to the criteria specified in the text.
Implement all getters and setters as well as methods for adding elements to an array where necessary.
