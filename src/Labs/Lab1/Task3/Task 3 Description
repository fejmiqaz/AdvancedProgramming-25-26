You are given the following classes:

Class Doctor

Represents a doctor with basic information about him: license number, his name, expertise level (1-10), number of patients
If the expertise level is 10, the doctor is considered to be a Chief.
The toString method has been implemented, which prints the doctor in a readable format (name, license number, specialization, number of patients, and if he has the highest level of expertise, [Chief] is also printed.)
When changing the level of expertise, the value must be in the range of 1-10 and must not be lower than the previous one
Class EmergencyRoom

represents an emergency room in a hospital and contains information about: the name of the hospital, medical staff (an array of Doctor objects), capacity
The following methods have been implemented: treat, forEach, count, findFirst, filter, mapToLabels, mutate, conditionalMutate, countForEvaluation, evaluate
treat(Supplier<Doctor> supplier) - adds a doctor to the emergency room, if there is a free place
forEach(Consumer<Doctor> action) - applies a given action (Consumer) to each doctor in the array (example: print)
count(Predicate<Doctor> condition) - returns the number of doctors who meet the given condition
findFirst(Predicate<Doctor> condition) - returns the first doctor who meets a given condition
filter(Predicate<Student> condition) - Returns a new array containing only the doctors who meet the condition.
mapToLabels(Function<Student, String> mapper) - Returns an array of text descriptions, obtained by transforming each doctor with the given function.
mutate(Consumer<Student> mutator) - Applies a change to all doctors (for example, increasing the level of expertise)
conditionalMutate(Predicate<Student> condition, Consumer<Student> mutator) - Applies the change only to doctors who meet the given condition.
countForEvaluation(DoctorEvaluator evaluator) - Uses DoctorEvaluator to count how many doctors meet a condition
evaluate(DoctorEvaluator evaluator) - Returns a new array containing all doctors who meet the condition set by DoctorEvaluator
toString() - Returns a text description of the emergency center, containing the name of the hospital, the number of doctors currently working in it and a list of them.
On your part, you need to:

Create a functional interface DoctorEvaluator that will have one method: boolean evaluate(Doctor doctor);
Create a class HighExpertiseEvaluator that will return TRUE only if the doctor has an expertise level greater than or equal to 7.
Resolve the requirements in the main section:
Open a Scanner and read an integer n that indicates the number of doctors to be entered.
Create a Supplier<Student> that reads data about a doctor from the console (license number, name, expertise level and number of patients) and returns a new Doctor object.
Add n doctors to using the treat method.
Use Consumer<Student> together with forEach to print all doctors currently working in the emergency center.
Use the created functional interfaces to determine which doctors:
have more than 20 patients
have a higher level of expertise (7+)
Combine the two states from the functional interfaces and use the evaluate method of the EmergencyRoom class to display only those doctors.
Use findFirst to find and display the Chief doctor in the emergency room.
Use mutate to increase the expertise level of all doctors by 1.
Use conditionalMutate to increase the expertise level of only doctors with more than 30 patients by 1.
Use mapToLabels to transform all doctors into text descriptions and print them.
Finally, print all the information about the emergency room using the toString method.
