Implement a class LibrarySystem that will manage book reservations in a library. The class should contain members and books.

Book class
The class Book consists of:

identification number - isbn
title
year of publication
and other attributes needed for successfully tracking copies and loans.
Member class
The class Member consists of:

identification number - id
name
and other attributes needed for borrowing books.
Methods for the LibrarySystem class
Constructor: LibrarySystem(String name)
void registerMember(String id, String fullName) – registers a member among the other members, where each member initially has no borrowed books.
addBook(String isbn, String title, String author, int year) – adds a book to the library, where a single book may have multiple copies.
If a book with the same ISBN already exists, then the number of copies is increased by 1.
If it does not exist – it is added with 1 copy.
void borrowBook(String memberId, String isbn) – the member wants to borrow a book.
Rules:

If the book does not exist, the action is ignored.
If the book exists but has no free copies, the member is placed on a waiting list for that book.
If there is a free copy: it is assigned to the member and the number of available copies is decreased.
void returnBook(String memberId, String isbn) – when a member returns a book:
The number of available copies is increased.
If there is a waiting list for that book – the first member on the list is automatically assigned a loan of the book (same as borrowBook).
void printMembers() – print all members sorted by number of borrowed books (descending), and if equal, by member name (ascending).
Example for one line:

Gorazd (id27) - borrowed now: 5, total borrows: 17
void printBooks() – print all books sorted by number of borrowings so far (descending), and if equal by year of publication (ascending).
Example for one line:

isbn1 - “The Hobbit” by Goch (2025), available: 199, total borrows: 2
void printBookCurrentBorrowers(String isbn) – print the current ID numbers of the borrowers of the book with that ISBN, sorted and separated by commas.
void printTopAuthors() – print the authors sorted by number of borrowings of their books (descending), and if equal, by name (ascending).
Example for one line:

Goch - 127
